        <p>
            Valorant is a team-based first-person hero shooter set in the near future. <br>
             Players play as one of a set of Agents, characters designed based on several <br>
              countries and cultures around the world. In the main game mode, players are assigned <br>
              to either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it. <br>
              Why its one of my favorite games? <br>
              Due the team-building and costum games <br>
              as you can challenge your friends to a 1V1 or <br>
              can do casual games with your friends <br>
              as you make a bigger bond with your friends <br>
              and can trust them aswell <br>
              but as you too need a strategy in the game <br>
              trying to defuse or activate the bobm <br>
              oh i hear you asking my favorite agents? <br>
              well it would be chose between <br>
              Viper or razor <br>
              Well that all for valoront by now <br>
