        <p>
        osu is a game where you actually just click <br>
        circles as you complete the beatmap on the <br>
        ofcourse <br>
        As their is a variaty of different beatmaps <br>
        and songs withing from vocolaid to high tech music <br>
        as their are plenty but plenty different <br>
        and cool beatmaps makers <br>
        and as they make the beatmaps you can play <br>
        for plenty but plenty hours and learn <br>
        new genres of music but you asking why <br>
        this game is standing in one of my favorite games? <br>
        well mostly cause the though of thinking fast and the movemnt <br>
        skill you need to produce for clicking the circle on time <br>
        as you grind for higher and diffuclter maps <br>
        as you learn aswell how to do jumps and streams <br>
        while you aswell have the power to beat much <br>
        more diffuculter maps at the same time <br>
        I will tell more later aswell and talk about <br>
        my career in the osu!-comminity <br>
        so see you until then <br>
