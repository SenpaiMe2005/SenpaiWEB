        Why? <br>
        This game is such a lovely one but now you ask why ofcourse <br>
        Well their are some reason of that <br>
        One! cause it has a pretty good story-line <br>
        Two! Every charcater desing of the cookies <br>
        or always amawing! <br>
        Three! The gacha system! I just love the feeling when a epic comes out of <br>
        your oven and by the luck of chance its the cookie you wanted!<br>
        That why i love this game. <br>
